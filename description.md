Welcome to the **Bayesian Calibration & Inverse Prediction Tool**.

This app lets you:

- Define any calibration equation (e.g. linear, exponential, power law, or anything you like)
- Fit it to your calibration data using Bayesian MCMC (Stan)
- Predict **X** from new **Y** values with full uncertainty quantification
